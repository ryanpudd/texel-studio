"""
Internal helpers for job handlers.

The shape we want for a handler is:

    def run(self, params, ctx) -> Iterator[Event]:
        ...

But many internal engine functions (run_agent_stream, the Gemini reference
generator) are *synchronous* and produce progress via callbacks, not yields.
This module provides the bridge: the handler kicks off the sync work in a
thread and yields Events out of a Queue as the worker thread populates it.

This is the same pattern as server.py:_run_agent_sse, factored out so every
handler can use it without re-implementing thread management.
